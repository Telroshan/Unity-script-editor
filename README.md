# Unity script editor

_Tested on Unity 2019.3.0f1_

This tool provides a simple script editor inside Unity, for those times you just want to make a quick change to your script without opening your IDE.

Instead of the standard readonly preview of your script, you can write there, then save or discard your changes.

_Note : This tool only applies to monoscripts, thus script assets, so don't worry, it's not going to alter any of your monobehaviour custom editors !_
